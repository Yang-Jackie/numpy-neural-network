# NumPy Neural Network

A **from-scratch implementation** of a deep neural network built using only **NumPy** and trained on the **MNIST handwritten digits dataset** (imported via `keras` / `tensorflow`).

This is my *personal learning project* to understand how **neural networks** work internally. It consists solely of self-implemented components:
* Neural network structure
* Forward pass & backpropagation & weight updates
* Loss and gradient calculation
* Data preprocessing
* Training and testing loop
